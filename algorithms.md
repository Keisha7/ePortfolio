## Enhancements Made
- Optimized algorithm efficiency  
- Developed a static model
- Reduced computational complexity  

## Explanation

I have selected the Travlr app full stack web application that was created last semester.  The Travlr app is a travel booking app that I built last semester. It’s a full-stack app, which means it does everything from planning trips to managing payments. The app uses a special data model called the Trip Mongoose schema to keep all the trip information organized and easy to find.  I chose this because it’s super important to how the app handles real-world travel data. It also shows that I can design, build, and improve data structures and algorithms in a modern web environment.  These improvements show not just my technical skills, but also my understanding of efficient data management, validation, and scalable architecture skills that are super important in computer science.
	I added a super cool feature to my program. It’s a static method that can search for trips by name or resort. It uses regular expressions, so it’s case-insensitive and can match partial matches.  I’ve added a cool method to calculate the average price per resort using MongoDB’s aggregation framework. I have developed a static method to identify travel itineraries within a user-defined date range.  I demonstrated how to create a virtual property that calculates the end date of each trip based on its start date and length. I also explained how to create some useful data structures.  I indexed the fields that people use the most to make things faster.
	Improving the Travlr application’s data model delivered valuable understandings into the mild balance between performance and maintainability.  Making sophisticated queries and authentication processes emphasized the importance of writing clean, modular code that can naturally adapt to changing needs.  I had a hard time making sure that all the features, like the custom search, worked well even as the data kept growing.
