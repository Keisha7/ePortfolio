# Code Review Video

**Video Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyiaB7RbCmk&ab_channel=KeishaYearwood%28Keisha%29

In this code review, I walk through the original artifact, analyze its functionality, identify areas for improvement, and outline my planned enhancements across Software Design & Engineering, Algorithms & Data Structures &Databases.  I speak about the existing code and improvements that are planned.  I focus on the app.js from MEAN stack Travel Booking application.  This sets up the Express Server, middleware configuration, and error handling.  App.js is the main entry point.  It plays an important role in organizing how the application sets and handles requests.
