# Databases Enhancement

**Artifact Title:** Mean Stack: Databases
**Original Creation Date:** July 2025 
**Languages/Technologies:** JavaScript

## Enhancements Made
- Integrated advanced SQL/MongoDB queries  
- Improved data validation and sanitation  
- Added secure CRUD operations  

## Explanation

I have selected the Travlr app full stack web application that was created last semester.  The Travlr app is a travel booking app that I built last semester. It’s a full-stack app, which means it does everything from planning trips to managing payments.  The Trip schema shows how I can turn JSON data needs into a typed, self-checking model.  In this update, I’ve added some  features like strict field validation, default values, and indexes. These changes show how well I understand keeping data clean, making things run faster, and finding what you’re looking for.  By centralizing the database connection logic and enhancing the seed script’s idempotence, I’ve showcased my ability to make maintainable and flexible code that works flawlessly across different environments.
These enhancements helped me get a better grasp of MongoDB schema design patterns and the trade-offs between indexing and write performance.  I discovered a way to use Mongoose hooks to standardize data and enforce business rules before saving it to the database.  One thing I had to deal with was finding a balance between being strict with validation and having some elasticity with scripts.  I think the process, reinforced, constant iterative testing.
